If you are a fan of DeBarge or just curious about their music, you might be interested in downloading and listening to their complete Motown albums. However, finding and buying their original CDs or vinyl records can be difficult and expensive nowadays, as they are out of print and rare. Fortunately, there is a way to get all their Motown albums in one package, for free and legally. All you need is a keyword: "Debarge - Time Will Reveal The Complete Motown Albums 2011.rar".
  
This keyword refers to a file that contains the digital copies of all the Motown albums of DeBarge, plus some bonus tracks and remixes. The file is compressed in a format called RAR, which reduces its size and makes it easier to download and store. The file was created in 2011 by Hip-O Select, a division of Universal Music Group that specializes in reissuing rare and classic albums. Hip-O Select released a limited edition box set of DeBarge's Motown albums, titled Time Will Reveal: The Complete Motown Albums, which included three CDs with 43 tracks in total. The box set was sold out quickly and became a collector's item, but Hip-O Select also made the file available for download on their website for a limited time.
  
However, since then, the file has been removed from Hip-O Select's website, and it is no longer possible to download it from there. But don't worry, there are still some ways to find and download the file using the keyword. Here are some methods you can try:
  
## Method 1: Use a web search engine
  
One of the simplest and most common ways to find and download files on the internet is to use a web search engine, such as [Google](https://www.google.com/), [Bing](https://www.bing.com/), or [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/). A web search engine is a tool that allows you to enter keywords or phrases and get a list of results that match your query. You can then click on the results to access the websites that contain the information or files you are looking for.
  
If you decide to use this method, you will need a web browser, such as [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/), [Mozilla Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/), or [Microsoft Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge), to access the web search engine and download the file. You may also need a VPN (virtual private network) service, such as [NordVPN](https://nordvpn.com/), [ExpressVPN](https://www.expressvpn.com/), or [CyberGhost](https://www.cyberghostvpn.com/), to hide your IP address and encrypt your traffic, so that your ISP (internet service provider) or authorities cannot track your online activity or block your access to certain websites.

Once you have these tools ready, you can follow these steps:
  
1. Go to a web search engine of your choice and enter the keyword: "Debarge - Time Will Reveal The Complete Motown Albums 2011.rar". You may have to try different variations of the keyword or use quotation marks to narrow down your results.
2. Look for a result that matches the file name, size, and date of the file you want. Be careful of fake or malicious links that may redirect you to unwanted sites or download unwanted programs.
3. Click on the result and read the description carefully. Make sure it is the file you want and that it has positive comments and feedback from other users.
4. Click on the "Download" button and wait for your download to start. Some websites may require you to create an account, verify your email, or enter a captcha before you can download the file.
5. Once your download is complete, go to your download folder and extract the RAR file using a program like [WinRAR](https://www.win-rar.com/) or [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/).
6. Open the extracted folder and enjoy listening to the complete Motown albums of DeBarge.

## Method 2: Use a torrent site
  
Another way to find and download files on the internet is to use a torrent site, such as [The Pirate Bay], [1337x], or [RARBG]. A torrent site is a platform where users can share files with each other using peer-to-peer technology. You can find almost any file you want on torrent sites, including movies, music, games, software, and of course, DeBarge's Motown albums. However, torrent sites are also illegal and risky, as they often contain viruses, malware, or spyware that can harm your computer or steal your personal information. Moreover, downloading copyrighted content without permission is a violation of intellectual property rights and can get you in trouble with the law.
  
If you choose this method, you will need a torrent client, such as [uTorrent](https://www.utorrent.com/), [BitTorrent](https://www.bittorrent.com/), or [qBittorrent](https://www.qbittorrent.org/), to download the file from the torrent site. You will also need a VPN service, as some torrent sites may be blocked or restricted in your region.
  
Here are the steps you can follow:

1. Go to a torrent site of your choice and search for the keyword: "Debarge - Time Will Reveal The Complete Motown Albums 2011.rar". You may have to try different combinations of words or use quotation marks to narrow down your results.
2. Look for a result with a green skull icon next to it, which means it is verified by the site moderators.
3. Click on the result and read the description carefully. Make sure it is the file you want and that it has positive comments and feedback from other users.
4. Click on the "Download" button and choose a torrent file or magnet link to download. A torrent file is a small file that contains information about the file you want to download, while a magnet link is a URL that directly connects you to the file.
5. Open your torrent client and add the torrent file or magnet link to it. You should see the file name, size, seeds, peers, and progress of your download.
6. Wait for your download to finish. This may take some time depending on your internet speed and the number of seeds (users who have the complete file) and peers (users who have parts of the file) available.
7. Once your download is complete, go to your download folder and extract the RAR file using a program like WinRAR or 7-Zip.
8. Open the extracted folder and enjoy listening to the complete Motown albums of DeBarge.
