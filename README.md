[![BASH History Suggest Box](http://mindforger.com/projects/images/hh-animated-01.gif "BASH History Suggest Box @ YouTube")](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPF29NyXe2U)


DESCRIPTION
-----------
Are you looking for a command that you used **recently**? Do you
want to  avoid the need to write **long commands** over and over
again despite you used them recently? Are you looking
for a tool that is able to manage your **favorite** commands?

HSTR is a command line utility that brings improved BASH command completion 
from the history. It aims to make completion **easier** and more **efficient**
than `Ctrl-r`.

Apart to the completion, history can be **managed** (you can remove 
commands that e.g. contain sensitive information like
passwords) and bookmark your favorite commands.
