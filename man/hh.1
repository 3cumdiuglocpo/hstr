.TH HH 1
.SH NAME
\fBhh\fR \- suggest commands from shell history
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B hh
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B hh
uses shell history to provide suggest box like functionality
for commands used in the past. By default it parses .bash-history
file that is filtered as you type a command substring. Commands 
are not just filtered, but also ordered by a ranking algorithm
that considers number of occurences, length and timestamp. In addition
hh allows removal of commands from history - for instance with a typo or with a sensitive content.
