.TH HH 1
.SH NAME
\fBhh\fR \- shell history suggest box
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B hh [option] [arg1] [arg2]...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B hh
uses shell history to provide suggest box like functionality
for commands used in the past. By default it parses .bash-history
file that is filtered as you type a command substring. Commands 
are not just filtered, but also ordered by a ranking algorithm
that considers number of occurences, length and timestamp. In addition
hh allows removal of commands from history - for instance with a typo or with a sensitive content.

.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
\fBhh\fR defines the following environment variables:
.TP
\fBHH_CONFIG\fR
Configuration options. \fBhh\fR is monochromatic by default - use \fBhicolor\fR to get more colors.
Make the pattern-based filtering case sensitive using \fBcasesensitive\fR. Force raw history view instead
of metric-based one using \fBrawhistory\fR. Example:
.nf
.sp
export HH_CONFIG=casesensitive,hicolor         # color version with case sensitive search
.sp
.fi
.SH CONFIGURATION
Optionally add the following lines to ~/.bashrc:
.nf
.sp
export HH_CONFIG=hicolor         # get more colors
shopt -s histappend              # append new history items to .bash_history
export HISTCONTROL=ignorespace   # leading space hides commands from history
export HISTFILESIZE=10000        # increase history file size (default is 500)
export HISTSIZE=${HISTFILESIZE}  # increase history size (default is 500)
export PROMPT_COMMAND="history \-a; history \-n; ${PROMPT_COMMAND}"
bind '"\eC\-r": "\eC\-a hh \eC-j"'    # bind hh to Ctrl-r
.sp
.fi
The prompt command ensures synchronization of the history between BASH memory 
and history file.
